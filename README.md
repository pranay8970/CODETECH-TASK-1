 Objectives:
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset to understand its characteristics, distributions, correlations, and outliers.
- Visualize the findings using various plots to gain insights into the data.

 Key Activities:
1. Data Loading: Load the dataset using `pandas`.
2. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, and any inconsistencies in the data.
3. Data Exploration:
   - Summary Statistics: Compute summary statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
   - Distribution Analysis: Plot histograms and box plots to understand the distribution of variables.
   - Correlation Analysis: Compute and visualize correlations between variables using heatmaps.
   - Outlier Detection: Identify and visualize outliers using scatter plots and box plots.
4. Data Visualization: Use `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to create various plots for visualizing the data.

 Technologies Used:
- Python: The programming language used for the analysis.
- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- numpy: For numerical operations.
- matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- seaborn: For statistical data visualization based on `matplotlib`.

 Key Insights:
1. Distribution of Variables: Histograms and box plots revealed the distribution of the data, highlighting skewness and the presence of outliers.
2. Correlation between Variables: Heatmaps showed significant correlations between certain pairs of variables, indicating potential relationships.
3. Outliers: Scatter plots and box plots identified outliers, which could be important for further analysis or modeling.
